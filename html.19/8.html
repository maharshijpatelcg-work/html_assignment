    <h1>HTML Elements Showcase - Inline vs Block</h1>\
    <p>\
        HTML elements are divided into inline and block types to control how content is structured and displayed on a webpage.

Block elements (like <div>, <p>, <h1>) always start on a new line and take up the full width available. They are used for larger structural sections of a page.

Inline elements (like <span>, <a>, <strong>) do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as their content. They are used for styling or linking small parts of text within a block.

This division makes it easier for developers to organize content, separate structure from styling, and ensure consistent page layouts.
