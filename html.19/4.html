    <h1><b>The History of Computers and the Internet</b></h1>
    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>The first generation of <b>computers relied on bulky vacuum tubes</b>, which were inefficient and generated immense heat. <i>This gave way to the second generation, which utilized transistors to create smaller</i>, faster, and more reliable machines. <u>The third generation was defined by the integrated circuit (IC)</u>, which miniaturized transistors onto a single silicon chip, enabling even greater advances. <strong> With the fourth generation, the microprocessor placed an entire central processing unit on one chip</strong>, paving the way <em> for the personal computer revolution</em>. We are currently in the fifth generation, <mark> which focuses on artificial intelligence, parallel processing </mark> , and advanced connectivity. <small> Each new generation has been marked by a <cite>significant reduction in size and cost coupled with a </cite>dramatic increase in speed, power</small>,  and efficiency. This relentless progression has transformed <del> computers from room-sized</del>, specialized instruments into ubiquitous <ins> devices that power modern life</ins>. The evolution <q> continues toward more intuitive, powerful</q>, and integrated systems that <blockquote> will further blur the line between the physical and </blockquote> digital worlds.</p>
