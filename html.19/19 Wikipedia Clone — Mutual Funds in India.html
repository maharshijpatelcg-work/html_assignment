      <h2>Mutual fund statistics</h2>
      <p>The first mutual fund in India was introduced in 1963 when the Government of India launched the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_Trust_of_India">Unit Trust of India</a> (UTI). Mutual funds in India are broadly categorised into equity funds, hybrid funds, and debt funds.</p>
      <p>As of <strong>31 December 2023</strong>, total Assets Under Management (AUM) of the Indian mutual fund industry stood at <strong>₹50.78 trillion</strong> (approximately US$600&nbsp;billion).<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
      <p>According to regulators and official reports, a majority of mutual fund units are redeemed within two years of investment, with a small percentage of units held beyond five years.<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
